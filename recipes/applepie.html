    <h1 class="maintitle">Salted Caramel Apple Pie</h1>
    <img class="image" src="../recipes/pie.jpg" alt="Sweet salted caramel apple pie">
    <h3 class="title">Description</h3>

    <p class="main">
    This salted caramel apple pie is as decadent as a dessert can get. It's an impressive end to any meal, but it's absolutely perfect for holiday entertaining. 
    </p>
    <p class="main">
    Though this salted caramel apple pie is perfect as-is, a dessert this indulgent could certainly benefit from a dollop of homemade whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream to cut the richness. 
    </p>

    <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="main">
        <li>For the crust: all-purpose flour, kosher salt, unsalted butter, and water</li>
        <li>For the sauce: white sugar, salted butter, heavy whipping cream, and fine sea salt</li>
        <li>For the filling: Granny Smith apples, white sugar, all-purpose flour, lemon juice, cinnamon, kosher salt, ground cloves, and nutmeg</li>
        <li>For the topping: one egg and turbinado sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="title">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="main">
        <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour and salt, then work in the butter. Stir in the water. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead until it's smooth. Divide the dough into two discs, wrap in storage wrap, and chill each half in plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat the sugar until it's melted and amber in color. Add the butter, then add the cream. Remove from the heat and add the salt. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Stir the filling ingredients until well-combined. Let it sit for about 30 minutes, then pour it through a strainer into a large bowl. Thicken the liquid on the stove. Allow the liquid to cool to room temperature, then stir it into the apple mixture.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough: Turn each dough disc out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll them out into 12-inch circles.</li>
        <li>Assemble the pie: Press one of the dough halves into a pie pan. Add the filling, then top with Â½ of the caramel sauce. Place the remaining dough circle over top and crimp the edge. Brush the top with a beaten egg, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and cut slits into the dough with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li> Bake the pie: Place the pie on a baking sheet. Bake at 400 degrees F until the top is light golden brown, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and continue baking until the top is a deep golden brown. Serve with the remaining caramel sauce. </li>
    </ol>
